VERSION : V0.5   (move to CLAIRE4)

1. Project Description 
======================

Evolutionary  ML Agents


2. Version Description:  (a regarder sur PC)
======================

This is the first version, the goal is to be done in a month, to produce two slides
for CSDM

v0.2:
- restart the experiment in 2014, to produce a test case about Free, and to produce new slides for Compiegne


3. Installation:
===============

this is a standard module, look at init.cl in wk.

	
4. Claire files
===============

log.cl:            as usual, the log file => where to look firt to read about the current state
model.cl           data model: companies, experiments & scenarios, initialization + utilities
tseries.cl
algebra.cl
gauge.cl
evol.cl
	
5. Related doc
==============
overall description may be found at http://organisationarchitecture.blogspot.com/

6. Data
=======

This project uses scenario files (look at oai to use a similar approach)


7.Test and run (merge with PC)
==============

As usual, the test file is test*.cl (currently test1.cl)
The test file contains the configuration
  - description of the companies
  - definition of the experiments
  - go* methods which simply run go(E)
